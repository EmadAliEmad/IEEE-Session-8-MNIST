# IEEE-Session-8-MNIST

This repository contains a Python notebook (`IEEE Session 8 MNIST.ipynb`) that explores and applies several machine learning models to the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. The goal is to classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) using different algorithms and to evaluate their performance.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is 28x28 pixels and contains a single grayscale digit.

The dataset is loaded from two CSV files : `mnist_train.csv` and `mnist_test.csv` , which can be found in the same folder of the notebook.

## Implemented Models

The notebook explores the performance of the following classification models:

*   **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A powerful, versatile model known for high accuracy on complex datasets.
*   **Logistic Regression:** A linear model suitable for classification problems.
*   **Random Forest:** An ensemble model that can handle non-linear data patterns.

## Code Overview

The Python notebook (`IEEE Session 8 MNIST.ipynb`) consists of the following steps:

1.  **Import Libraries:** Imports necessary libraries like `pandas` for data handling, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization, and `sklearn` for machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
2.  **Load Data:** Loads the MNIST training and test datasets from CSV files into pandas DataFrames.
3.  **Data Exploration:** Displays the dataframe information and shows some sample images from the training set.
4.  **Data Preprocessing:** Scales and normalizes the data to improve the training efficiency of the models.
5.  **Model Training:**
    *   Trains SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest models on the scaled training data.
    *   Evaluates each model's accuracy on the test set using the `accuracy_score` metric.
    *   Evaluates models using cross-validation with `cross_val_score` .
6.  **Model Evaluation:**
    *   Prints the accuracy of each model.
    *   Generates `classification_report` and `confusion_matrix` for each model.
    *   Visualizes the confusion matrix of the best model (Random Forest) using a heatmap.
7.  **Model Optimization (GridSearchCV):**
    *   Applies GridSearchCV to find optimal hyperparameters for the SVM model.
    *   Optimizes the Logistic Regression model using built-in cross-validation.
    *   Applies GridSearchCV to find optimal hyperparameters for the Random Forest model.
8.  **Result Summary:** Prints the best found hyperparameters and the corresponding score for all the optimized models.

## Results

The notebook outputs the following key results:

*   Accuracy scores for each model on the test data.
*   Cross-validation scores for each model.
*   Classification reports, which include precision, recall, and F1-scores for each class.
*   Confusion matrices, showing the model's classification performance.
*   A heatmap of the confusion matrix for visual analysis.
*  Best hyperparameters found for each model.

Based on the notebook results, the **SVM** and **Random Forest** models showed the best performance in terms of accuracy.

## Recommendations for Improvement

1.  **Data Visualization**: Consider adding more visual analysis of the data before model building. Visualizing the digits distribution and other potential data characteristics is crucial.
2.  **Feature Engineering**: The notebook could include some basic feature engineering. For example, dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA to reduce the number of features can be added.
3.  **More Advanced Models:** There are other machine learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that are better suited for this classification task.
4.  **Detailed Explanation of GridSearch :** When performing GridSearchCV on hyperparameters. A clear explanation of hyperparameter tuning is crucial to ensure model optimization.
5.  **Cross Validation Explanation:** A more thorough explanation of cross-validation, its importance, and how different models are evaluated should be added to the documentation.
6.  **Model Selection and Justification**: Why random forest was selected as the best model, and why it performs better than others (or the reasons for other models' poorer performance) could be mentioned in the Readme file.
7.  **Error Analysis**: Analyzing where the model fails (e.g., by visualizing misclassified images) could lead to further improvements.
8.  **Deployment**: A demonstration of how the trained model could be used to predict labels for new, unseen digit images is beneficial.
9.  **Code Styling**: To make the code more readable and easy to follow by implementing a coding style guide such as PEP 8.
